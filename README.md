To start your Phoenix server:
  * I have used psql for the db hence having pgadmin will be good.
  * Once the repo has been cloned go to config/dev.exs and set up your db configs.
  * Run `mix setup` to install and setup dependencies. This will also create the tables and seed the data in the db.
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000/language`](http://localhost:4000/language) from your browser.
